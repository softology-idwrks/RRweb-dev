	  <p class="idx_step_text_gray"><strong>Studies 
		  have shown that we are capable of reading many times faster than our 
		  current average speed.</strong> Currently on a computer screen that's only about 100 words per minute. For a book, somewhere around 200+ depending on the reader. RapidReader was developed from more than 15 years 
	  of research and development to find a practical way for the power of the computer to assist us in raising our reading speed for everyday use. <br>
	  <br>
      </p>
	  <p class="idx_step_text_gray">&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="idx_step_text_gray">RapidReader isn't voodoo science or a novelty app. It's the result of adapting hard science to solve a real world problem. EDIT EDITNow it's used by thousands of people all over the world. It helps them efficiently read and process information far faster than before .It was estimated by Forbes that managers are reading up to three hours a day just to keep up with the information they need to be effective. 20 years ago that amount of information wasn't even available much less required. The responsibility for what we need to know is there but the method we use to access it is the same as it was 5000 years ago. That was the problem SoftOlogy set out to resolve through the combined use of technology, psychology and our natural ability to process information. (address? adapt? take more advantage of? etc our natural ability to process)<br>
	    <br>
      The topics below explain the science behind the factors that slow us down and why RapidReader works so easily to help us to overcome the barriers to reading speed so efficiently </p>
	  <p class="idx_step_text_gray">&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="idx_step_text_gray"><br>
	    <br>
	    It plays to our natural strengths. If you compare the task of reading 
	    with the ease of watching a movie that fact becomes instantly clear. No one 
	    has to teach us how to watch a movie. EDIT EDIT.</p>
      <p><strong>write ABOUT THE STUDY AT JOHNS HOPKINS READING 1600 WPM</strong></p>
      <p>In studies conducted at Johns Hopkins University Wilmer Eye Institute a group of participants accelerated their reading speed from an average of 200 wpm to more than 1600 words per minute with comparable comprehension. These were ordinary subjects and there was no training or practice involved. How did they do it? The experimenters changed the method of reading from moving the eye from word to word across a page of text to displaying the words to the subjects as a sort of &quot;movie&quot;. The results were immediate and astonishing. By streaming the words in a sequence one at a time in the middle of the field of vision the ability to read was instantly multiplied. What this showed and has been repeatedly confirmed is that <span class="idx_step_text_gray"><em>when it comes to reading speed it's not our comprehension that slows us down. It's actually our inability to see the words faster. It's about our eye muscles and the process of capturing the words on the page. </em></span></p>
      <p>What it comes down to is that us are still using  a method TO READ that hasn't advanced in 5,000 years. By using technology in the lab to change the presentation of the words the limits of having to rely on slow, exacting and tiring eye movement were removed. Our brains were free to do what they do best, see something and quickly process the information we receive rather than waiting for our eyes to catch up.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>SYMBOLS</p>
      <p>Visual cortex</p>
      <p>However there was a catch. Comfort ITS ALL IN THE DETAILS TO MAKE IT PRACTICAL. </p>
      <p>RSVP is a bit like a machine gun flashing words at you like bullets. It's inherently uncomfortable. The challenge was to make the technology assist in a natural, comfortable way. This led to the insight of using the rhythm of natural speed to modulate the way the words were presented. Just like someone would speak. We are hardwired for speech and those rhythms contribute significantly to comprehension as well as ease. The Devil was however in the Details. What were those cadences? How do you make a computer display words in a way that wasn't robotic? The answer lay in analyzing the speech patterns of real humans and mimicking the way they used cadence. This wasn't the stiff formality of punctuation or simply the length of words but rather a flexible foundation which changes continually with the speed of presentation. It took nearly 10 years of trial and error, refinement and sampling to arrive at a truly natural experience of rhythm in language. This process of refinement continues at SoftOlogy constantly improving and adapting to accelerate written communication. There's a lot more to the story. For a detailed description of the  rationale and methodology used in the development of RapidReader Engine as well as the supporting clinical research please follow the LINK to continue.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>So Technology FUNDAMENTALLY changes that. Before the computer came along there was no real way to accelerate the mechanics of reading. YOU STILL HAD TO MOVE YOUR EYES ACROSS THE PAGE. You still had to locate each word in your field of vision.</p>
      <p>This technique came to be called RSVP for &quot;Rapid Serial Visual Presentation&quot;. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p class="idx_step_text_gray">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="idx_step_text_gray">When it comes to reading speed it's not our comprehension that slows us down. It's actually our inability to see the words faster. It's about our eye muscles and the process of capturing the words on the page. </font></p>
	  <H3>What it comes down to is having to use a method TO READ that hasn't advanced in 5,000 years. Technology FUNDAMENTALLY changes that. Before the computer came along there was no real way to accelerate the mechanics of reading. YOU STILL HAD TO MOVE YOUR EYES ACROSS THE PAGE. You still had to locate each word in your field of vision.<br>
	    <br>
	    A written word is simply a symbol that has a meaning. Once we learn that meaning our brains can recognize their shapes  almost immediately.</h3>
	  <p class="idx_step_text_gray">We are <strong>extremely</strong> efficient 
	    at recognizing patterns and visual symbols. We do it almost instantaneously every day. Once we know what a symbol means we can recognize and process it at extremely high 
	    speeds. For our ancestors this skill was important for survival. Today it may mean not walking into the wrong bathroom. The issue isn't recognizing or comprehending but rather the mechanics of reading that interferes. </p>
	<p class="idx_step_text_gray">In the clinical setting they found out that there is an important advantage 
	    to moving the text to the center of our field of vision and displaying 
	    it to us like a movie. What happens is that we recognize the words for 
	    what they actually are <strong>symbols.</strong> Like a stop sign. We 
	    don't need to sound them out to know what they mean...  all we have to do 
	    is look. </p>
	<p class="idx_step_text_gray">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="idx_step_text_gray">TALK ABOUT THE COMFORT FACTOR AND RHYTHM BEING THE KEY TO MAKING IT PRACTICAL <br>
	    <br>
	    As we develop a &quot;sight vocabulary&quot; The association between the symbol and meaning is automatic. 
	    This translates into much higher reading speed. </p>
	  <p class="idx_step_text_gray">To further support the research findings in another study, subjects were given a brain 
	    scan while reading in this fashion. The result was surprising. It turned 
	    out that a completely different part of the brain lit up. It wasn't the 
	    area linked to reading and language it was the area called the <strong>visual 
	    cortex</strong>. This is where we process visual information including symbols. 
	    And our brains are very fast at pattern recognition. We are much faster at identifying symbols than we are at converting 
	    them into language and then sounding them out. That's why RapidReader 
	    Works so well. It simply accommodates the display of words to the way we most 
	    naturally process symbols. It's sort of &quot;cuts out the middleman&quot; and allows 
	    us to understand directly from what were seeing. RapidReader's speed isn't &quot;voodoo&quot; it’s 
simply the practical application of real science refined through development of a technology to solve a problem. Overcoming the barriers to reading faster.</p>

                  We've all had the experience of forgetting what we just read. Actually our brains are much faster at processing information than we are able to move our eyes to read it.RapidReader's compelling high speed display dramatically improves your reading focus by accelerating the reading process. It holds your attention while making it easier for you to digest more information in less time. </a></li>
